The first visualization centers on a timeline that shows how immigration has ebbed and flowed over the years. Immigrants’ region of origin is color coded, shifting from Europe and the Middle East to Asia and Latin America. The information is represented in brush-like strokes that evoke the oil paintings in the book.

Details layered at the edge of the wave feature subsets like the number of refugees and asylees admitted to the US, and immigrants awarded the Nobel Prize—one third of all US prize-winners. A graph at the top and bottom measures foreign-born population as a percentage of the US population, and a sidebar breaks down 2018 US immigrant status.

The second infographic functions as a kind of immigration road map, showing how complex the process is to become a citizen. Adapted from an existing graphic, the visualization is structured like a yes/no flowchart, organized around the four main pathways to obtaining a green card—through employment, diversity, family or investment.
